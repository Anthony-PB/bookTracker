//Notes:

// Axios is a JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from the browser (or Node.js). (Browser Postman that is useful)
// It simplifies the process of sending asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and performing CRUD operations 
// (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

// useEffect: This hook runs the code inside it when the component mounts (renders for the first time)

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.
Essentially, an API acts as an intermediary that enables the interaction between different software components, systems, or services.
